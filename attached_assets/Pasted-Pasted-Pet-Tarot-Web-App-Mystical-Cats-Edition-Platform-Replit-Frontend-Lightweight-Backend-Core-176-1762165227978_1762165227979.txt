Pet Tarot Web App (Mystical Cats Edition)

Platform: Replit (Frontend + Lightweight Backend)
Core Stack: HTML/CSS/JS (or React), Node.js / Express
Purpose: Interactive tarot reading experience themed around Mystical Cats, where an AI cat gives tarot readings from a feline’s point of view.

1. Core Concept
Overview

This app is a pet-themed tarot reading service using gemini free model, centered on Mystical Cats Tarot.
The experience is designed to feel like the user’s own cat is reading their fortune.

Key Features

Users ask a question about their cat.

The chatbot responds as the cat, referring to the user as “butler.”

Tone: friendly, brief (max 3 sentences per response).

The chatbot must not use “meow,” “nyang,” or emojis.

The chatbot must not say the title of cards.

Tarot card front and back illustrations are randomly generated.

All card backs are identical.

All illustrations can be manually replaced later (asset extensibility).

Initially supports Major Arcana only, but structure allows adding Minor Arcana.

2. User Flow
2.1 Home Screen
Element	Description
Header	Displays “Cat Tarot” at the top center.
Left-top	‘Home’ button.
Bottom-left	Stack of face-down tarot cards.
the most Bottom       Question input field.
The area above is a placeholder for future banner ads (reserved height).

2.2 Question Input & Shuffle

When a question is entered and the user clicks the card stack,
the stack moves toward the right-center of the screen.

A shuffle animation plays.

If the card stack is clicked before entering a question,
→ No animation; show message: “Please enter your question.”

2.3 Card Spread

After shuffling, cards spread out automatically on the right side with animation.
(Use translate/rotate or staggered transitions.)

2.4 Card Selection

The user selects cards one by one among the spreaded cards.

Each selected card flips (3D transform) to reveal its face.

After selecting three cards, the cat chatbot is automatically triggered.

2.5 Result Popup

A result window (popup modal) appears.

The cat chatbot interprets the three chosen cards and delivers a short reading.

2.6 Chatbot Response Behavior
Aspect	Specification
Response length	Max 3 sentences.
Tone	Friendly, reflective.
Prohibited	No “meow/nyang” words, no emojis.
Display logic	Text stays inside popup boundaries. If overflow → show arrow (>).
Pagination	Clicking the arrow smoothly scrolls to the next part of the text.
2.7 Return to Home

After reading all chatbot responses,
clicking the ‘Home’ button (top-left) resets the app:

All cards return to face-down stacked state.

The question field clears.

3. System Design Notes
Area	Implementation Detail
Frontend	HTML/CSS/JS or React (for animation and state).
Animations	CSS keyframes or GSAP/Web Animations API.
State Management	Simple JS store or React state.
Backend (optional)	Node.js/Express API endpoint for LLM calls.
LLM Integration	Use external free API (gemini).
Image Assets	Store in /assets/cards/; JSON map links each card name → image path.
Extensibility	Card data (names, meanings) stored in cards.json. Easy to add Minor Arcana later.
Localization	Korean / English switching possible (optional).
4. Example LLM Prompt
You are a cat speaking to your butler.
Respond in a friendly and reflective tone.
Your answer must be within 3 sentences.
Do not use “meow,” “nyang,” or emoticons.

5. Technical Constraints & Notes

Replit does not include built-in AI models; use external free APIs.

Reserve space at the abobe of the input box for future ad banners.

All illustrations must be user-replaceable.

Optimize for mobile screen widths (touch selection & smooth animations).
