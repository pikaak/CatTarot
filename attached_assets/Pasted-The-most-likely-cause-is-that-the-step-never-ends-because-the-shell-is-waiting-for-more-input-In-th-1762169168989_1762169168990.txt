The most likely cause is that the step never ends because the shell is waiting for more input. In the Replit build log,

Run shell command:
cd attached_assets/generated_images && for card in "The_Empress" ... "Justice"...

If it ends with only "for", like this, it's likely one of the following:

The for statement is incomplete (missing do/done).

The quotes are mismatched (e.g., there's no closing " , like in "Justice").

A backslash \ remains at the end of the line, causing it to wait for the next line.
→ In this case, the shell will continue to wait (appearing to be infinitely loading).

A safe example to rewrite (one-liner):

cd attached_assets/generated_images && for card in "The_Empress" "The_Emperor" "The_Hierophant" "The_Chariot" "Strength" "The_Hermit" "Wheel_of_Fortune" "Justice"; do echo "processing: $card"; done

More robust (check directory + debug):

set -euo pipefail
cd attached_assets/generated_images || { echo "❌ No folder"; exit 1; }

set -x # Print which command is being executed
for card in "The_Empress" "The_Emperor" "The_Hierophant" "The_Chariot" "Strength" "The_Hermit" "Wheel_of_Fortune" "Justice"; do
img="${card}.png"
if [[ -f "$img" ]]; then
echo "✅ found $img"
# Insert the actual conversion/copy command (e.g. magick, cp, etc.) here
else
echo "⚠️ missing $img"
fi
done
set +x

Quick Checklist

Make sure for ...; do ...; done is correctly entered.

Make sure all card names have closed quotes (a full pair, like "Wheel_of_Fortune").

Make sure there are no extra \'s at the end of lines (if there are, it will wait for the next line).

Test the command with echo "$card" before actually executing it.

If it's a script file, check for syntax errors with bash -n your_script.sh.

If the program still hangs after making the above changes, the "actual command" being executed at that step may require interaction or be a never-ending process. At that time, leave only echo and see if it ends normally, then return the work commands one by one to narrow down where it stops and you will be able to find the cause.
